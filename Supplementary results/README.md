Two supplementary loop setups are presented: non-overlapped and over-overlapped loops.
In both setup, the loop are placed above the 0.5 sigma conductivity phantom, and tuned at 500MHz. 
The results are shown following the same presentation as in Figure 6.

Also, the Bosma equation for a four-channel system is shown with symbolic notation.
